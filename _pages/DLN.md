Title: Navigating the Digital Wilderness: My Journey into Digital Humanities

As a 21-year-old university student, I embarked on a new academic adventure this semester: an introductory course in Digital Humanities. Although I am well aware of the complexities and possibilities of Digital Humanities, I believe I still have so much to learn and grasp in order to utilise such knowledge for my own digital benefit. This narrative explores my evolving digital literacy journey, the strategies I employ in my daily and academic life, and my aspirations for what lies ahead of me.

Before enrolling in this course, my digital literacy skills were primarily centered around the basics and essentials. I knew how to use many digital platforms such as different social media sites, conducting research online and writing research papers using different platforms, and composing emails. My content creation process revolves around the tools available to me on my devices but I also like to venture out and try new platforms and sites. Socially, I interact with friends and classmates on Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, and Discord but I never delved into the deeper aspects of online communities or digital communication.

In my daily life, I used Google Drive for document storage and Google Calendar for scheduling, but I never truly explored and delved into the wealth of digital tools available for research, data management, and analysis. Frankly, I was swimming in the shallow end of the digital pool, unaware of the vast ocean of possibilities that awaited me simply because I was unaware of how to navigate through this vast array of possibilities. 

Enrolling in this Digital Humanities course was a pivotal moment. The course is exposing me to a plethora of digital tools and concepts that have and are broadening my horizons. I'm learning about content management systems like WordPress, which opened up new avenues for blogging and website creation. Markdown language became my go-to for formatting text, and platforms like GitHub allowed me to collaborate with others on coding projects. Additionally, I really enjoyed using the Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme for this class's website that I'm actually using it for my capstone blog as well!

Social interaction, too, took on a new dimension as I started using Discord and Reddit more, which is facilitating discussions and collaborations in ways I had never experienced before. I am beginning to see how online communities form around shared interests, and I am realizing the potential for networking and learning from experts in various fields. Moreover, as I explored Digital Humanities more deeply in preparation for the MA I'm aiming to hold in the future, I discovered just how vast and beyond exciting it is. I believe I have gained a better understanding of the essence of Digital Humanities and how vital/useful it is in this day and age. 

However, the true eye-opener was when we delved into data analysis. Getting to visualize data in different ways and writing a report about it has been one of the most useful and enjoyable experiences. Though I thoroughly enjoyed the HAM API assignment where we got to pick three different cultures and look into them closely and their collections and characterizations in the Harvard Art Musuem, I much preferred working with texts. Using the R markdown notebook on Posit Cloud and Voyant Tools to analyze F. Scott Fitzgerald's first three novels: This Side of Paradise, The beautiful and Damned, and The Great Gatsby, felt like a revelatory moment. Not only was I able to look closely into books I have not even read, but I was able to deduce forms of writing relating to the author and his era + but I was also able to make analyses identical to ones made by people that actually read the books. In addition to the analyses in each book, I was also able to put the three books in juxtaposition and analyze them accordingly very swiftly. 

My current abilities have grown significantly, but I am keenly aware of how much more there is to learn. The course has truly ignited a passion for digital humanities, pushing me to seek further knowledge independently. I now understand that digital literacy is not a static skill but a constantly evolving journey. I aspire to become proficient in data analysis, mastering statistical techniques and data visualization tools to unlock the potential of big data in humanities research, especially textual data relating to historical matters.

Furthermore, I am intrigued by the ethical implications of digital humanities. As we navigate the digital landscape, questions about data privacy, biases in algorithms, and the accessibility of digital content are more relevant than ever. I hope to explore these issues deeply and contribute to discussions on responsible and equitable digital practices and the ways in which others can navigate them as well. 

In conclusion, my journey into digital humanities has been a transformative experience. From a basic digital literacy background, I have ventured into the realms of content creation, social interaction, and research data management and analysis. While my current abilities have grown, I am aware of the vast expanse of knowledge yet to be explored, and I am beyond eager to delve into it. My aspirations include mastering digital textual analysis, understanding the ethical complexities of the digital world, and continuing to adapt and evolve as a digital citizen. This course has opened my eyes to the possibilities and responsibilities that come with digital literacy, and I am excited to continue my journey in this ever-evolving digital wilderness beyond by undergrad years.
